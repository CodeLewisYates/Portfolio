      <p>
        I am a self taught web developer with a passion for creating both
        beautiful and functional websites. I wish to pursue a career in web
        development, and am currently freelancing to provide my clients with
        websites to be proud of! I have experience in developing both the front
        end and back end areas of websites. <br /> <br /> I have been interested
        in programming since secondary school, where I took computing as a GCSE
        and went on to do the same in college. Iâ€™ve taken several courses from
        sites such as udemy, however most of my learning has been completely
        self taught. I have developed a variety of skills in different
        programming languages and frameworks to be able to develop any site or
        web app you could think of!{" "}
